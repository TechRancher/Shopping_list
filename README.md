# Shopping_list
This is a smiple shopping list program I made to pratice on my Python skills.  
At the beginning of the program the user will also be shown the help function 
The app will ask for the user to add an item to the shopping list.
Each time the user adds an item they will be told how my items are in the shopping list.
At the end of the use of the app the user will type DONE and the program will end but will show the user the total list
